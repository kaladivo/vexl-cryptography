# vexl-cryptography

## Building
All you have to do is to run:
```
make
```
The library will appear in `./product/darwin`.
Please note that the library currently supports only macOS (even on apple silicon, but make sure you run your terminal under rosetta). More architectures comming soon.

## Testing
Simply run:
```
make
make run
```
